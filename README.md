# PCA Python Project 💥👁‍🗨

## Here is my project using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" data set. I search this data set from " https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground " which is a very good resource of free Data Sets. I choose this data set because it have 24 variables, so is enought large to apply PCA and I found interesting to study what are the main reasons to achieve passenger satisfaction.
